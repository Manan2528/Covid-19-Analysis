Covid 19 Analysis - Power BI

This project is a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data. It combines Python (via Jupyter Notebook) and Power BI to download, clean, and visualize COVID-19 data from different countries and timelines. The goal is to provide meaningful insights into the spread of COVID-19, recovery and death trends, and the countries most and least affected by the virus.

The project demonstrates the power of data analysis in understanding real-world issues and how tools.
